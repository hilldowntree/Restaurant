# Restaurant

A website I created for a nonexistant resteraunt.

Only HTML and CSS.

Things which would be nice to add:
-responsive
-simple css animations
-change the photos, add a side scroll, or change photos when user clicks on type of meals
-add modals when user clicks on food photos
-make buttons do things. Currently all buttons and links are static
-scroll through menus when buttons are clicked
